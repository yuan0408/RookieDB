# RookieDB

![The official unofficial mascot of the class projects](images/derpydb-small.jpg)

This repo contains a bare-bones database implementation, which supports
executing simple transactions in series. In the assignments of
this class, you will be adding support for
B+ tree indices, efficient join algorithms, query optimization, multigranularity
locking to support concurrent execution of transactions, and database recovery.

Specs for each of the projects will be released throughout the semester at here: [https://cs186.gitbook.io/project/](https://cs186.gitbook.io/project/)
